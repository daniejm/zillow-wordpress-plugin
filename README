Allows embedding of Zillow real estate data via widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin adds new widgets that can be embedded through any standard widget mechanism (shortcode, customizer, etc). The widgets use Zillow Partner API, and make use of 24 hour transients to cache data and prevent overuse of the Zillow API service.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin .zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload via the Plugins menu on the admin screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

= What can I do with this plugin? =

For now it only has a widget which embeds your latest reviews from Zillow. In the future I hope to add more widgets that tap into other features of the Zillow Mortgage API.
